This project aims to simplify and guide the way beginners make their first contribution. If you are looking to make your first contribution, follow the steps below.

If you don't have git installed on you machine, [download it.](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)


#### This is your checklist:
- [ ] Fork a repo on GitHub
- [ ] Clone a repo
- [ ] Commit changes
- [ ] Push changes to GitHub from terminal
- [ ] Submit a pull request (PR) on GitHub
- [ ] Update a repo



## Fork this repository
Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top right of this page. This creates a copy of this repository on your account.

 </p>

Open a terminal and run the following command:
```
git clone <url you just copied>
```
where ```<url you just copied>``` is the url you copied from the clone dialog box

For example:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-github-name/git-workshop.git
```
where ```your-github-name``` is your github user name. This downloads a copy of the repository onto your computer

## Create a Branch
Change to the repository directory on your computer.
```
cd git-workshop
```
Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command 
```
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```
For example,
```
git checkout -b add-firstname-lastname
```
## Make necessary changes and commit those changes
Now, create a .md file titled `<your-full-name>.md` where `<your-full-name>` is your full name and in it write your full name and something about yourself.
```
# Add Your Name Here
### A Brief Description about yourself

If you now go to the project directory and execute the command `git status`, you'll see there are changes.
Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command
```
git add your-full-name.md
```
Now, commit those changes using the `git commit` command
```
git commit -m "Add <you-full-name> to git-workshop"
```
replacing `<your-full-name>` with your full name

## Push changes to GitHub
Push your changes using the command `git push`
```
git push origin <add-your-branch-name>
```
replacing <add-your-branch-name> with the name of the branch you created earlier.


## Submit your changes for review
If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a Compare & pull request button. Click on that button.
